<h1> Project 2 </h1>

<p> This is a project that notifies people if someone is at their door, it's particularly useful for children and pets. In this repository there is also the code, and diagrams to help understand how it works. I will be using the MIT license, so that it can be redistributed. To install, just follow the schematic diagrams, and run the code. </p>
